## What is pgBadger?

pgBadger is a fast PostgreSQL log analysis reporter.

## Usage
### How to use this image
This image contains the `pgbadger` executable and is meant for one-off uses. The entrypoint assumes all arguments are targeted for the `pgbadger` executable and additionally configures jobs parallelization using the number of cores attributed to the container and sets the `--out-dir` to the value of `$PGBADGER_DATA`.

For example, considering `PGBADGER_DATA=/data` and the number of available cores to the container is `4`:

```sh
$ docker run --rm uphold/pgbadger /var/log/postgresql/postgresql.log
```

Would translate to:

```sh
pgbadger /var/log/postgresql/postgresql.log --jobs 4 --outdir /data
```

If you'd like to run other commands on the container, you will need to replace the entrypoint by setting it on the command line via `--entrypoint`.

Here is a sample usage with `docker-compose` that mounts the volumes from a running `postgresql` container and saves the report on the `./cache/pgbadger` directory mounted from the host:

```yml
pgbadger:
  image: uphold/pgbadger
  command: /var/lib/postgresql/data/pg_log/postgresql.log
  volumes:
    - ./cache/pgbadger:/data
  volumes_from:
    - postgres:ro
```
